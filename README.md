## HOW-TO

1. Launch the program
2. In title screen, click anywhere to continue to prompt map
3. Type in your chosen destination tile coordinates
4. Choose your pathfinding mode: 1 for DIJKSTRA'S, 2 for A*, 3 to compare both
5. Move your NaviGator using WASD in isometric space
6. Press R to reset and enter a new destination

## FEATURES
1. Isometric tile rendering (32x16 diamond tiles)
2. Character movement aligned to tile grid
3. Path visualizer with glowing color-coded lines
4. Walk animation with frame-switching
5. User-friendly UI for input, instructions, and feedback

Each path is recalculated in real time based on NaviGator's position and destination
